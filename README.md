# :boom: Graduate-Admissions : SOPs :orange_book:

Graduate Admissions is tricky waters. As the admission season comes up, I have been getting a lot of requests asking me to share my SOPs. Having applied to various cohorts, and various programs, I have had my fair range of different SOPs. To make it easier and help people build their own SOPs I have created this respository with all my SOPs. If you find this respository useful consider sharing with your friends and ofcourse feel free to give a star! If you are interested in sharing your SOPs and material with the community, Feel free to put them down in a Folder with your Name and submit a pull request! Will get right back at it.

Please note, you might find a lot of repetition across the SOPs. But should give you some idea on how I went about changing the SOPs for different Universities and with different application cycles (2020 and 2021). You can also observe the transition between MS SOPs and PhD SOPs. Other material which might help in your admission process.
